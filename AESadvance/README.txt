Let's figure out what we can optimize here: Step by Step!

	#1. ByteSub: No need to change.
	#2. Shift: No need to change.
	#3. Mix: Get the result matrix beforehand and compute them to simplify the process.
	#4. AddKey: I guess there still are no need to change.

	Basically, what we want to do here is just simplify the #3 step.
	And that is enough.
